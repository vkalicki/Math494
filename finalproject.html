        <h2><u>The Committe</u></h2>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <p> The people who will draw the new districts for Illinois will be an independent firm or group that will be chosen from a bipartisan committee with an equal vote from each side.
        </p>
        
        <p>The group will consist of 10 Democrats, 10 Republicans, and 9 independent members. This group size will be this way to ensure there is no tie.</p> 
        <p>Each of the people in this group must have voted in the past 4 state elections. They must not have any affiliation with any candidates that are running or have run. They must not have affiliation with any candidates that currently hold an office of power. They must not be related to anyone running for office or who are currently in office or have any relative that work for the person who ran or is running for office such as spouses, siblings, family, or friends.</p>
        
        <p>They must not have contributed more than 1000 dollars towards any political part or super PAC’s. </p>

        <h2><u>Reshaping the Districts</u></h2>
        
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        
        <p>When reshaping the districts for Illinois, some basic standards must be followed. The size of the district should be in proportion to the amount of population in the district as to give people an equal opportunity to make their votes count.</p>
        
        <p>The district must be contiguously connected and may not be split into two different shapes. The shape of the district must be either a rectangle or square shape to make sure that the district does not get gerrymandered to favor any specific political party and will be tested using the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/074683410X510317" target="_blank"><i>Convex Method</i></a>.The district cannot be below a .5 convex ratio or else the district will be considered gerrymandered.</p>
        
        <p>If the district’s sshape is irregular due to the shape of the state, such as its borders to lakes or rivers, then the convex ratio may be lowered to a .4 to allow for a district to be created fairly. </p> 
        
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polsby-Popper_Test" target="_blank"><i>Polsby-Popper Method</i></a> will also be used to check if the district is gerrymandered by testing if the perimeter of the district is much larger than the area of the district. This method will be used to ensure that all the space inside of a district is utilized and to ensure fairness.</p>

        <h2><u>Public</u></h2>
        <BLOCKQuote>
       <p>The redistricting plan will be transparent and will have the data on the plans to redistrict available to the public. The information will be distributed at police stations, town halls, and there will be a website that shows the information and allows for people to submit their opinions.</p>
            
       <p>The public will also be able to be heard through public forums that will be held in each of the previous districts, prior to reshaping them, to get the public’s opinion and suggestions on how to make the redistricting plan fair and equal.</p>
       <p>There will also be tele-surveys taken of 15,000 people in the state of Illinois, and the people being surveyed will be selected at random from each district to get a general idea of what the people from those areas would like to see with the redistricting plan.</p>
    
        </BLOCKQuote>
        
        <h2><u>Finalization</u></h2>
        
        <BLOCKQuote>
            
       <p>The redistricting plan will be officially approved after a majority of the independent group vote to finalize it after each district has been officially reshaped to account for convexity, population, and contiguousness. After every district has been approved, the proposed plan will be redistributed to the public to collect any grievances that citizens may have about the plan and to resolve any issues (if deemed necessary) by the independent group.</p>
            
        <p>After any grievances have been resolved within a timeframe of 3 months, then the plan will go to the bipartisan group to be voted on to accept the new districts.</p>
            
        <p>The vote must pass with a majority from the bipartisan group to be official. Then upon being passed, the districts must be prepared to account for their new shapes and sizes and be prepared by the election after the next one.</p>
